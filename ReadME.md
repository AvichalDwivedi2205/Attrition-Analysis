# Predicting Troop Betrayal in the War
Against the Phrygians
As you prepare for the inevitable war against the Phrygians, you face a dangerous internal challenge: betrayal within your own ranks. Historically,
many Xernian soldiers have been lured by the Phrygians’ promises of wealth
and power, abandoning their clan and joining the enemy. As the troop leader,
your mission is to predict which soldiers in your current army are most likely
to betray your clan and join the Phrygians.
To prevent betrayal, you must design a decision-making system that analyzes various factors about your troops and flags those who are most likely to
defect. This system will help you manage your forces strategically and prevent
treachery.
The Challenge
Your task is to architect a system that evaluates the likelihood of betrayal within
your army. Consider various factors that could influence a soldier’s decision
to betray the clan, including greed, temptation, poor respect, and more such
factors. Focus on quantifying these factors into data points that can be used as
features for your system.
Objective
Develop a decision-making system that evaluates each soldier based on the data
you define from your hypotheses and predicts the likelihood of betrayal. Focus
on:
• Identifying key factors (features) from your hypotheses and converting
them into data that can indicate a higher likelihood of betrayal.
• Designing a workflow for how your system would analyze the data and
rank each soldier based on their risk level.
• Presenting a well-thought-out approach to decision-making, outlining how
the system evolves and adapts as new data is gathered, making it more
scalable.
